### Skate Park Javascript

This is another set of exercises from Turing School designed for Javascript practice. My goal here is to continue practicing javascript, and make all of the tests pass one by one.

### Running the Tests

- Create a new package.json file by running 'npm init'
- Run npm install in the root directory
- Run `npm install chai` to install chai for testing
- Run the command `npm test skate-park-javascript-test.js`
